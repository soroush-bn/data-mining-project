# data mining for [University Of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/)
### introduction : 
In this project, we will go through all the courses in all faculties of Bern University, and we will 
fetch the **required data** for the next phase of project, in which useful data will be extracted.
___
### 1.phase one :
This phase is dedicated to **scraping** data from the  [course page]("https://www.ksl.unibe.ch/KSL/veranstaltungen?1/") by using a selenium crawler which can be found 
in [*crawler.py*](https://github.com/soroush-bn/data-mining-project/blob/main/Crawler.py).
Two methods were implemented for getting courses data:
1. looping through all faculties, then all courses of that faculty and getting necessary data from each coloumn.

`def get_course_data(self, course):`

2. simply using the **download option** that website provided us :D.

`def download_standard_report(self):`
